Christmas is comming up!
I have been excel this year,so I can't wait to find gifts under my tree.
My friends are all asking for banana and mango for Christmas, but if I had to pick the one thing I want most, it would be BIKE.
Don't forget to drink milk when you get to my house!
I'll have plenty of cookies for you, and extra snacks for reindeer.

Sincerely,
	Leo Kungulio.
