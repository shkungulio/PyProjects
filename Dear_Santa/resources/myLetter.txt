Christmas is comming up!
I have been excellent this year, so I can't wait to find gifts under my tree.
My friends are all asking for pizza and pie for Christmas, but if I had to pick the one thing I want most, it would be TAMALE.
Don't forget to drink coca when you get to my house!
I'll have plenty of cake for you, and extra snacks for reindeer.

Sincerely,
	Yours, Leo Kungulio.
